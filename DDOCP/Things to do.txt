Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

rnett:
It has to be calculated anyways to show the DC. It would be nice to have the
caster level displayed for damage calculations.
Also, misic caster level effects (Arcane Augmentation, Reflection of the Wave's
elemental form buff) and elemental based caster level bonuses (Sorcerer enhancement
trees, Draconic Incarnation Dragon Spell Knowledge) currently don't show up anywhere
else, if there are even calculated.

All instances of Divine Might (Cleric, Faored Soul, and Paladin) are now:
Battle Trance: You gain an Insight bonus to Attack, Damage, and the DC of
tactical feats equal to 1/2 of your Charisma modifier for 30/60/120 seconds.
War Soul's Divine Will is now: Battle Trance: You gain an Insight bonus to Attack,
Damage, and the DC of tactical feats equal to 1/2 of your Wisdom modifier for 30/60/120 seconds.
Divine Might, Divine Will, Harper's Know the Angles, and Falconry's Deadly
Instinct's Damage components now provide an actual Insight bonus to Damage
(as their tooltips claim they do), meaning:
They all provide Damage to both Melee and Ranged attacks.
They do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Damage.
The ones that provide Attack do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Attack.


 1097 (and earlier) Incorect BAB calc for BAB=Character Level
This one is pretty minor. The various abilities and spells that set
BAB=Character Level will take the effective BAB all the way to 30;
eg. Bard WC Core 4, Tensors, Divine Power, Cleric/FVS Warpriest T5,
and EK T4. They don't unlock feats, but the 30=BAB will effect attack
bonus (to-hit), attack rate (25 cap for melee, 30 for ranged), and PRR
bonus from armor.


Default Re: v.79 Skullsmasher Crash (Bjond)
The T1->T5 Rogue Mechanic Sharpshooter and T5 Sniper bonuses don't include
the extra damage for non-repeating crossbows and don't restrict the extra
sneak attack dice to only non-repeating/non-dual crossbows. Tried hacking
the Enhancements.xml and got all the stuff in it except the sneak dice
-- looks like sneak dice don't accept restrictions or at least not in the
same way as regular damage bonus (so, I could either make it correct for
non-xbow or make it correct for xbow, chose the latter).


Few things I've noticed in playing with it. *Prayer* and *bless* spells have had
their description updated (to denote scaling) but the bonus they grant has *not*
increased over in the breakdowns pane, staying at +1. *Angelskin,* likewise, is
only granting a +1 bonus to PRR, no matter the caster level (*righteous command*
appears to have the opposite problem, granting the full +15 melee/ranged power no
matter your caster level.)






Feats
The Accelerate Spell metamagic feat can now be taken as a Class Feat choice starting at Artificer Level 8.



So, I added an "export gear set to text" button with v0.5.2. It spits out the following (a tank setup I use to test) :

Eye:Legendary Collective Sight{insight Charisma 10}{enhancement Wisdom 21}
Head:Legendary Standard Issue Faceplate
Neck:Legendary Standard Issue Sigil
Body:Legendary Watch Captain's Platemail
Back:Legendary Cloak of the City's Champion
Waist:Legendary Bronze Dragonscale Belt
Finger1:Legendary Celestial Emerald Ring{enhancement Strength 21}
Finger2:Stolen Signet of ir'Wynarn
Offhand:Legendary Rising Sun

The text between curly braces are optional parameters set for the item. Not sure if DDOBuilder does something similar.
